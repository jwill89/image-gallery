.SYNOPSIS
    Build and deploy the Gallery (PHP API + Vue SPA) to the DigitalOcean droplet.

.DESCRIPTION
    The Gallery repo is split into backend/ (PHP) and frontend/ (Vue), but the
    droplet's webroot is FLAT — the project root IS the Apache document root
    (index.php serves the built SPA from dist/, .htaccess routes /api to the Slim
    app and serves media/ files directly). So deployment flattens backend/* and the
    built SPA (frontend/dist) into one payload that mirrors that layout, then runs
    Composer and database migrations on the host.

    Steps:
      1. Build the frontend (vue-tsc + vite) -> frontend/dist  (skip with -SkipBuild).
      2. Pack a tarball of *code only*, mapping the split repo onto the flat webroot:
           from backend/  -> index.php, .htaccess, api/, includes/, db/ [migrations +
                             setup.php, NOT gallery.db], phinx.php, openapi.json,
                             composer.json, composer.lock, scripts/
           from frontend/ -> dist/
         Data dirs (vendor/, .env, cache/, logs/, dupes/, media/, db/gallery.db) are
         never included.
      3. Upload the tarball in a single pscp stream.
      4. On the host (one plink connection):
           - back up current code to .deploy-backup (rollback; skip with -NoBackup),
           - extract the new code over the webroot (leaving .env, db/gallery.db,
             media/, cache/, dupes/, logs/, vendor/ untouched),
           - composer install (incl. dev deps: Phinx, the migration tool, is a dev
             dependency)                                   (skip with -SkipComposer),
           - snapshot db/gallery.db to db/.backups/ via SQLite VACUUM INTO, keeping
             the five most recent                          (skip with -NoBackup),
           - run migrations via db/setup.php, which baselines a legacy (pre-Phinx)
             database before applying pending migrations    (skip with -SkipMigrate),
           - restore ownership to www-data and clear the API response cache,
           - health-check the API.
         If any step fails, the previous CODE is automatically restored. The
         database is NOT rolled back automatically — the failure trap fires on any
         non-zero exit, including after a migration has already succeeded, so
         reverting data could discard media uploaded during the deploy. A failed
         migration prints the snapshot path and the exact restore command.

    Uses PuTTY's pscp/plink so the DigitalOcean .ppk key works directly. They run
    in batch mode, so a passphrase-protected .ppk must be loaded into Pageant first:
        pageant.exe "<KeyPath>"   (enter the passphrase once per Windows session).

    The droplet runs `ufw limit ssh` (drops the IP after ~6 connections in 30s), so
    this uses just TWO SSH connections (one upload, one remote run). The upload is
    retried once after a 35s wait if it looks rate-limited.

.PARAMETER VpsHost      Droplet IP/hostname. Resolved from -VpsHost, then $env:DEPLOY_VPS_HOST, then scripts/deploy.config.ps1 ($DeployVpsHost).
.PARAMETER VpsUser      SSH user. Resolved from -VpsUser, then $env:DEPLOY_VPS_USER, then $DeployVpsUser.
.PARAMETER KeyPath      PuTTY .ppk private key. Resolved from -KeyPath, then $env:DEPLOY_KEY_PATH, then $DeployKeyPath.
.PARAMETER WebRoot      Apache DocumentRoot / app root. Resolved from -WebRoot, then $env:DEPLOY_WEB_ROOT, then $DeployWebRoot.
.PARAMETER PublicHost   Host header used for the post-deploy health check.
.PARAMETER SkipBuild    Deploy the existing frontend/dist without rebuilding.
.PARAMETER SkipComposer Don't run `composer install` on the host.
.PARAMETER SkipMigrate  Don't run database migrations on the host.
.PARAMETER NoBackup     Don't keep a .deploy-backup rollback copy on the host.
